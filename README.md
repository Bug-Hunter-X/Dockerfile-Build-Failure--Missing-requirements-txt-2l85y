This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: attempting to use a file before it has been copied into the image. The initial Dockerfile attempts to install dependencies listed in requirements.txt before the file is added to the image's context, resulting in a build failure. The solution involves reordering the COPY command to ensure requirements.txt is copied before the installation command is executed. This example showcases best practices for Dockerfile construction, emphasizing the importance of proper file ordering and dependency management.
